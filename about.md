# About Me

I'm Carlos Mora, a Platform Engineer with production experience building and operating multi-cloud infrastructure in regulated healthcare environments.

I've designed and deployed systems that manage multi-account Snowflake environments in production, automated Zero Trust networks connecting AWS and GCP, and built IAM audit tools for compliance teams.

## My Approach

- **Automate the complex**: If it's manual and error-prone, I build tools to automate it
- **Document everything**: 15,000+ lines of technical documentation proving depth over breadth
- **Security-first**: Every system includes graceful degradation, least privilege, and audit trails
- **Enable teams**: Build platforms that others can use without being experts

## Expertise Areas

### Multi-Cloud Infrastructure
Production experience with AWS and GCP, not just "hello world" projects. I manage real workloads spanning multiple accounts, regions, and compliance requirements.

**Real-world examples:**
- Multi-account Snowflake environments across AWS and GCP regions
- VPN connectivity automation across multiple VPCs
- Multi-cloud IAM governance tools

### Data Platform Governance
Operating data platforms at scale with cost controls, security automation, and compliance built-in.

**Experience:**
- Snowflake multi-account RBAC automation
- Databricks Unity Catalog on GCP
- Multi-layer cost defense strategies
- Automated change detection across accounts

### Security & Compliance
Healthcare compliance (HIPAA, SOC2, HITRUST) isn't a checkbox—it's embedded in architecture from day one.

**Implementations:**
- Multi-cloud IAM auditing tools
- Automated permission risk categorization
- Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)
- Credential rotation without downtime

### Infrastructure as Code
OpenTofu/Terraform modules built for production: tested, documented, and reusable.

**Patterns:**
- Multi-cloud module libraries
- GitHub Actions with OIDC (no long-lived credentials)
- State management and backend configuration
- Validation and pre-deployment checks

## Technical Skills

**Cloud Platforms:**
AWS (EC2, RDS, RDS Proxy, NLB, Secrets Manager, IAM, S3)
GCP (Compute Engine, Cloud SQL, Secret Manager, VPC, IAM, Cloud Storage)

**Data Platforms:**
Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery

**Infrastructure as Code:**
OpenTofu, Terraform, GitHub Actions

**Programming:**
Python (boto3, snowflake-connector, pandas, FastAPI), TypeScript/Node.js

**Security:**
Multi-cloud IAM, credential management, HIPAA/SOC2/HITRUST compliance

## Current Focus

- **Certifications**: [Google Cloud Professional Cloud Architect](https://www.credly.com/badges/21eb07dc-eebf-439a-b37b-3fd0130ff742) (Certified), Preparing for AWS Solutions Architect Professional
- **Writing**: Sharing multi-cloud architecture patterns and SRE learnings
- **Open Source**: Building sanitized versions of production tools for community use

## What Makes Me Different

Most platform engineers have toy projects or single-cloud experience. I operate production systems in regulated environments where downtime and security failures have real consequences.

**Production scale:**
- Multi-account Snowflake environments in production across clouds
- Extensive IaC deployments (OpenTofu/Terraform)
- Multi-cloud architecture across AWS and GCP regions
- Healthcare compliance automation at scale

**Documentation discipline:**
- Two-layer documentation strategy (public + private learning notes)
- 15,000+ lines of technical documentation
- Certification prep notes with 70%+ exam coverage
- Comprehensive decision logs and troubleshooting guides

**Security mindset:**
- Dry-run by default in all admin tools
- Graceful degradation when systems fail
- Multi-layer cost controls
- Zero long-lived credentials in CI/CD

## Beyond Code

After 25+ years in infrastructure—from on-premise data centers to multi-cloud at scale—I've learned that sustainable performance engineering applies to systems AND people.

As a neurodivergent engineer, I approach complex systems with pattern recognition that's both a strength and a responsibility. The same principles that prevent infrastructure burnout (observability, graceful degradation, capacity planning) apply to career sustainability.

The tech industry often celebrates "hustle culture" and endless availability. I've learned that the engineers who last decades—who ship reliable systems consistently—treat their own capacity as seriously as they treat system capacity. Monitoring your own metrics matters as much as monitoring your infrastructure.

I occasionally write about burnout prevention, neurodivergence in tech, and building careers that last decades, not just sprints.
